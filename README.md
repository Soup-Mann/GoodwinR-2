Challange#2 Add 2 numbers
This is a project that adds 2 numbers
Peer Review:Elizar Garcia, code works and looks great. First review ive done where someone used int64, very nice. I was a little thrown off when i got away with putting in a word with the first question but overall it will say invalid entry if you do not put in numbers. Overall great game!
